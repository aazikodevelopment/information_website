                    The purpose of a First Batch Inspection, or Intial Quality Inspection, is to check production procedures and quality of the “first
                    batch” of product. By correcting mistakes in the beginning stages of production, SeaRates can consult both our customer and their
                    factory on how to proceed in the most efficient and effective manner to save the order.

                    The purpose of a During Production Inspection is to check on production mid-way through the production process to check several
                    things including:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>- Will the factory be on-time on total production?</li>

                    Although the above things are important, perhaps the most important purpose for conducting a During Production Inspection is to
                    show the factory that you are serious and will be checking on this order throughout the process and when it comes to quality and
                    time requirements, you mean business! Let SeaRates help manage your order and your factory.

                    even Payment. When dealing with several orders at several different factories at the same time, it is not easy to stay abreast of
                    estimated production schedules. Compound that with the fact that factories are often not informative or open when it comes to
                    their own production schedules and orders might be delayed. SeaRates China has the capability to constantly check on the status of
                    your company's orders, accessible to you online 24 hours / day, 7 days / week so you have the knowledge you need to stay on top of

                    full inspection – just need someone to check in with the factory and confirm what the factory has reported. SeaRates offers the
                    economical Surprise Visit for a half-day service in coastal regions in China.
