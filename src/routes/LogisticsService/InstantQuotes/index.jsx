              <span>
                LCL is a cost-efficient option for buyers who want to save money
                with ocean freight, but donâ€™t have enough volume to fill an
                entire shipping container.

              <p>Full Container Load (FCL)</p>
              <span>
                FCL orders completely fill a shipping container. This is the
                best option for high-volume orders.

                A middle-ground solution between Air Express and Ocean. Designed
                for lighter freight shipments that are time sensitive but too
                expensive via standard express courier service.
